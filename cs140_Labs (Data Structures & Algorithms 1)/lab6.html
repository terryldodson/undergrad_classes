<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 6 (200 pts: Spring, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>

In this lab, you will gain familiarity with the binary search tree
data structure and the iterator abstraction. The first is a core data
structure. The latter is a core C++/STL concept.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas as usual.
The BST.h header file that statisfies BST1 and
drawings that illustrate the support functions needed by 
BST2 and BST3 are due 11.59pm 
Tuesday Apr 2, 2019; scan the drawings mentioned below to PDF or take photos and
submit JPG or PNG files (make sure they are readable).
The BST.h file that statisfies BST2 and BST3 is due 11.59pm Tuesday Apr 9, 2019.
Do not submit any cpp files. Your task is to update the binary search tree
template code which goes in the BST.h header file.
<p>

<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Write the following code. See the TAs well in advance
of the deadline to get your problems sorted out. This assignment
may be more difficult than you first think.
<b>
Base your code on the bst1 handout, which uses left and right
pointers, not the bst2 handout, which uses a link array of 
pointers.</b>

<UL>
<LI>
Run the /home/cs140/labs/lab6/copy script 
to obtain a skeleton header file called bst.h,
source code driver programs called
bst1_usage.cpp, bst2_usage.cpp, and bst3_usage.cpp, 
x86-Linux executables called bst1, bst2 and bst3,
as well as data files called
test1_int.txt and test2_int.txt for development purposes.
The executables showcase the functionality described next.
When in doubt about what to do, run these executables and study
the output.
Make sure your programs work on other data than the two files
given to you.
<p>

<LI>
For 40 points,
create the BST.h file needed to compile and run the BST1
program which is based on bst1_usage.cpp. Here is how you
do it.
<p>

Copy bst.h to BST.h. Strip out comments as well as
any code not needed like
the iterator subclass and all undefined bst member functions.
Add a node ID (int) and a parent pointer (node *) 
to the bst::node subclass.
Define
define and implement the bst::node() constructor.
Have the constructor take a node ID argument which is set
to 0 if absent, and use this argument to initialize the node ID.
Set the parent pointer to NULL.
<p>

The node ID is a unique integer assigned to nodes as they
are created. Add a node ID to the bst class which is initialized 
in the bst constructor and updated everytime a new node is 
added to the binary search tree. Update bst::insert to do the
latter and to pass the updated value along to the bst::node
constructor.
<p>

With respect to the parent pointer (or link),
be aware that bst::insert() is a recursive function which
does not have access to the parent when processing a node. 
You must therefore set the parent pointer as you ascend out 
of the recursion (when you reach the parent, you have access to the 
root of the subtree just processed).
<p>

Update bst::node::print() to output the node key, its ID,
the parent ID, and the left and right subtree IDs (if they exist).
See an output example below.
<p>

<LI>
For 25 points, make simple drawings that illustrate how 
the following three functions
described below are meant to work, namely,
bst::iterator::operator++() which implements a single step for
an inorder traversal, and
bst::lower_bound(key) and bst::upper_bound(key) which find nodes
that bracket a search range for a given key, i.e.,
lower_bound &le; key &lt; upper_bound.
Add a few sentences to explain your drawings but be succinct.
These drawings are meant for you to <b>think about functionality
before you think about code</b>. That is, you can't code what
you don't understand, and you don't understand what you can't
explain. This makes you explain.
<p>

<LI>
For 90 points,
modify BST.h as necessary to compile and run the BST2
program which is based on bst2_usage.cpp. A quick look
at the latter should convince you that this is a matter
of adding an iterator subclass to the bst class. Here
is how you do it.
<p>

Add public member functions bst::begin() and bst::end()
which respectively return an iterator that points to the node 
which holds the smallest key and an iterator that contains
a NULL pointer which indicates the binary
search tree has been exhausted (analogous to the first node
and the end of a single-linked list).
Recall that the smallest key is found in the leftmost node. You
find it by iteratively searching thru the sequence of
left children starting at the root of the tree. 
<p>

The bst.h file lists a number of iterator operators 
that must be included, namely:
++ PRE increment for an inorder move to the next node,
* for dereferencing and thus accessing the node key,
== and != for comparing iterators.
Base your code for these operators
on the list::iterator code covered in class.
This might be a good time
to read and understand the corresponding code 
handout which available from Canvas.

<p>
The ++ PRE increment operator is by far the most complicated
code you will write in this lab assignment.
Before you even think about programming it, make sure you
know how to carry out an inorder traversal with focus on
how to advance from one node to the next. Be aware that
you will NOT be using recursion. Each call to 
bst::iterator::operator++ must explicitly update the 
underlying node pointer to the next node.
<p>

Hint:
The bst::begin() function sets the node pointer to the
leftmost node in the binary search tree. The next node
is the parent thereof. The next node after that is the 
leftmost node in the parent's right subtree (if it has any).
You then return to that node's parent before you process
it's right subtree. Eventually, you return to the root
of the tree whereafter you descend into the main
right subtree. See the pattern?
Be very careful when you ascend out of the tree when
the last node has been processed. That is, you must
detect and handle an attempt to access the parent of the 
root node since it doesn't exist.
If you forget to this, your code will seg fault. Guaranteed.
<p>

When the bst::iterator subclass has been implemented, 
the print() function in bst2_usage.cpp will output
the content of the binary search tree in a lexicographically 
sorted order. See an output example below.
<p>

<LI>
For 45 points, 
modify BST.h as necessary to compile and run the BST3
program which is based on bst3_usage.cpp. A quick look
at the latter should convince you that this is a matter
of adding two public member functions to the bst class,
namely, bst::lower_bound() and bst::upper_bound()
which both take a key as input and return an iterator
corresponding to node in the binary search tree.
Here is how these functions are suppposed to work.
<p>

The bst::lower_bound(key) function must return an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is not less
than the given key, i.e., lower_bound &le; key.
If the key exists, the returned iterator points to that node.
If the key does not exist, the returned iterator points to 
the first node whose key value is greater. 
Your search must be based on explicitly
traversing the appropriate path from the root to the target
node. That is, do not use an iterator based inorder traversal.
<p>

The bst::upper_bound() function must return an iterator to the
first node in the binary search tree whose key is strictly
greater than the given key, i.e., key &lt; upper_bound.
If the key exists, the returned iterator points to the next 
node when performing an inorder traversal.
If the max key does not exist, the returned 
iterator should represent a NULL pointer.
Your search must be based on explicitly
traversing the appropriate path from the root to the target
node. That is, do not use an iterator based inorder traversal.
<p>

Hint: bst::lower_bound() and bst::upper_bound() are nearly
identical; their only difference is the comparison operator
used.
<p>

The iterators returned from bst::lower_bound() and
bst::upper_bound() are passed to the global print()
function which outputs the corresponding sequence of
data stored in the binary search tree.
See an output example below.
