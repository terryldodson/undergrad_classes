<title> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 7</title>

<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 7 (200 pts: Spring, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>

Yeah! You have made it to the last regular CS140 lab. This time,
you will put much of what you have learned together into one program.
That is, you will define multiple classes with public and private members,
overload an operator or two,
perform command-line option decoding, read data from a file, 
use a list (std::vector), a balanced binary search tree (std::map),
and a binary heap (std:make_heap) as well as associated iterators.
When completed, the program will print info to stdout for your
enjoyment. OK, maybe that's a stretch. But 
after not having been able to compile your program,
you will be glad to finally see it do something.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas as usual.
All code should be contained in a file called Labscores1.cpp or
Labscores2.cpp depending on far you make it.
The due date is 11.59pm Tuesday Apr 23, 2019. 
NOTE: Exam 3 is scheduled for Thursday Apr 18, 2019.
<p>

<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Write the following code. Seek help well in advance
of the deadline to clarify any points of confusion
you may have. 

<UL>
<LI>
Run the /home/cs140/labs/lab7/copy script 
to obtain a Hydra exectuable called slabscores, example data files
called name_scores1.txt, name_scores2.txt, name_scores3.txt,
and a makefile.
As usual, the executable showcases the functionality described next.
When in doubt about what to do, run this executable and study
the output.
<p>

<LI>
For 100 points,
create Labscores1.cpp as follows.
Have the main function read an unknown number of lines from a commandline
specified file.
Each line contains a first name and a last name followed
by an unknown number of integers representing 
fictitious CS140 students and their lab scores.
The data is to be reformatted and printed to stdout in sorted order
along with simple stats, namely, the median and mean scores.
See an output example below.
<p>

Create a class called name_t which holds and prints 
the student name.
Public members shall include a constructor if needed,
an overloaded less-than comparison operator, i.e.,
operator&lt;(),
which returns true if the string "lastname, firstname"
is lexicographically less than the corresponding string for a
right hand side argument,
and a function called print_name()
which produces the required output format including the 
printing of ellipses. Specifically, each "lastname, firstname"
output should be followed first by a blank space and then
by enough ellipses (...) to the point where the longest name
has two ellipses.
The first and last name strings must be private data members. 
Post-instantiation access should be done using
public set and get member functions if need be.
Any such helper functions must be given and
return references to strings instead of copies of strings. 
<p>

Hint: 
Each name object only knows about itself and neither has 
awareness nor access to other name objects (why?).
The max length consequently <it>has</it> 
to be determined elsewhere. For example,
the main function can determine the length of the longest
name when reading the input data. The max length can 
subsequently be passed as an argument to the 
name_t::print_name() function so that it knows how wide to 
make the name field. 
<p>

Create a class called labscores_t which holds and prints the
lab scores and stats.
Public members shall include a constructor if needed,
a function called add_data() for adding a lab score,
a function called set_stats() 
for sorting the lab scores and computing the median
and mean scores,
and a function called print_labscores() for printing
the lab scores and stats to stdout.
Use a vector to hold the lab scores. Make it and
the stats private data members. 
Depending on your overall implementation strategy,
this may again necessitate the addition of public
set and/or get functions.
<p>

Hint:
The median is found at index (N-1)/2 in a sorted 
N-element list.
Use can use the STL algorithms sort() and 
accumulate() to do some of the the heavy lifting.
See cplusplus.com for details.
<p>

The main function shall 
include command line parsing as well as
reading, parsing, and processing of data 
from a given input file.
That is, your
program must make sure that two commandline
arguments
are present where the first argument is
"-byname" and the second argument
specifies a file.
Proper program usage should be printed to
stderr if either argument is missing
as well as if unknown arguments are specified.
Mimic the behavior of the solution executable.
<p>

The main function shall use an std::map container
to store pairs of name_t and labscores_t objects.
The name_t object is the key that determines
where the data goes in the map.
The labscores_t object is the data that goes with it.
You will not be allowed to change the name_t
object once it has been inserted into the map.
You can change the labscores_t object data 
should you want or need to.
Your program must silently
reject insertion of new
data if the map already contains a node with the
same name_t object. 
<p>

For the Labscores1 program, data processing 
simply means printing the output in alphabetical
order. This in turn translates into an inorder
traversal of the map 
(which you may recall is a balanced BST).
Use an iterator based loop to achieve this.
<p>

Make no assumptions about the number of lines in
an input file. 
You may assume that an input file is structurally
consistent in that all students have a firstname
and lastname and that they all have the same number
of lab scores but make no assumptions what that
number is (it may vary from file to file).
<p>

<LI>
For 100 points,
create Labscores2.cpp as a modified version of
Labscores1.cpp which handles parsing of more
commandline arguments and, most importantly,
is able to produce and print sorted listings 
of the student records based on their scores.
You must use a binary heap to achieve the
latter functionality.
See an output example below.
<p>

The main function must be modified to accept either
"-byname", "-byrank', or "-top10" as its first argument.
You will need to keep track which of the
three options is specified, so you can
control the program behavior.
All options cause data to be read from
the given file as before. 
<p>

Create a class called heap_t which implements
a heap for map iterators. 
Public members shall include a constructor if needed,
a function called empty() which returns true if the heap
contains no data,
and 
a function called add_data() which adds a map iterator
to a vector object; the map iterator should be passed 
to the function by reference.
Public members shall also include
a function called heapify() which reorganizes the vector
object data to produce a binary max-heap,
and a function called extract_top() which pops and 
returns a copy of the map iterator stored by the 
max-element at the top the heap. 
Private members shall include the aforementioned
vector object which holds the map iterators that 
give you access to the student records stored in 
the map.
<p>

The map iterators must be wrapped in a private 
subclass called data_t which includes an overloaded 
less-than comparison operator.
Doing this makes it easier to use the STL
algorithms std::make_heap(), which heapifies a
vector object, and std::pop_heap(), which helps
maintain the heap as data is extracted. 
See cplusplus.com for details.
<p>

The max-heap is defined by the following less-than
comparision operator. An object specified by a
student record map iterator is less than another 
such iterator if
the mean lab score is the smaller of the two.
When two objects have the same mean score, 
use the median score to determine which is less than
the other.
When two objects have the same mean and median scores, 
use the name to determine which is less than the other.
See the "-byrank" output examples below.
<p>

Update the main function to choose
between printing the contents of the map in
sorted order by name or by score rank. 
Use the same heap based iterator loop to output
all student records by rank and just the top 10. 
That is, set the number of records to be output
for option "-byrank" to have an upper limit of INT_MAX
while option
"-top10" should set the upper limit to 10. Other than
that, these two modes work and operate in the exact
same way.
<p>


<LI>
Friendly warning: 
The compiler may complain vigorously when you try 
to compile your code.
One of the things you need to watch out for when
using iterator access of STL containers is
whether they should provide read-only access.
That is, you may need to use const references
and you may need to declare member functions const.
Of course, don't use a const reference if you plan
to change the data. Like all painful exercises,
you will learn an important lesson from this.
Fingers crossed you learn it quickly!
<p>

In a pre-emptive strike, make all function reference
arguments const unless the data needs to be changed.
Likewise, declare all class member functions that
do not alter the state of an object for const.
Undo as necessary to make the compiler happy, but
use read-only access as your default mode of
operation.
