<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 8 (110 pts: Spring, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
This is a chance to earn extra points, be they real
or for bragging rights. That is, some of you could use some
extra lab points. Some of you have nearly maxed out but 
need an extra challenge. 
Either way, this lab assignment is for you!
<p>

Positive integers can be written as the sum of prime numbers. 
In fact, a German by the name of Goldbach conjectured in 
1742 that even integers can be expressed as the sum of 
two prime numbers and that odd integers require at most 
three prime numbers.
According to Wikipedia, this can be shown empirically for
integers less than 4,000,000,000,000,000,000 but a proof
has yet to be established (anybody who do that is eligible
for a the Fields Medal in mathematics -- good luck!). Your
job is to write a program the enumerates these sequences
for user supplied integers less than 10,000.
Details are given below. 
Your score for this assignment will be added to your 
total lab score with the caveat that the latter 
can't exceed the max total score for the regular lab assignments. 
<p>

<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit the Goldbach.cpp file described below via Canvas as usual.
The submission deadline is 11.59PM on Tuesday, April 30, 2019.

<h3>Goldbach Partitioning</h3>

<p>
Your friendly instructor wrote and compiled a program
for partitioning integers greater than 2 
into the smallest sum of prime numbers.
While refactoring, he accidentally wiped out the code that does
it all. 
As you will see, the program consists of a main function that
instantiates a prime_partition object called goldberg which
can be treated like a function in that it can be given 
integers to partition. 
Your job is to recreate the prime_partition code.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
For 15 points,
define the prime_partition class so that it can get the job done
specified in the main function. You will need a constructor, an
overloaded function operator that takes an integer number as its 
sole argument, plus private member functions and data to support
the computation. You will not be able to complete this until 
you have worked out the overall solution, so keep reading. 
<p>

<LI>
For 20 points,
implement the missing create_pset function which should be
called by the prime_partition constructor to precompute
a table of prime numbers greater than or equal to 2 and 
less than 10,000.
The goal is fast lookup of the prime numbers when carrying 
out the partitioning.
Base this function on the plist code from Prime2.cpp 
(see Lab 3). 
Replace the list used then with a binary search tree 
in the form of an std::set object. 
<p>

Hint: You may find it advantageous to introduce pset_min and 
pset_max variables that hold the min and max values stored in 
the pset. Consider using std::min_element and std::max_element
for these calculations. 
These variables can be set by the prime_partition constructor
after create_pset has finished its job.
<p>

<LI>
For 20 points,
implement the missing function operator which takes an integer
argument, partitions it into its sum of prime numbers, and
prints the result to stdout. 
First carry out a Goldilocks check for
the given integer: it can't be too small, and it can't be too 
large. That is, numbers outside [2;10,000) should be rejected.
Then call a private member function called compute_partition, 
which determines which prime numbers add up to the given integer,
followed by a call to a private member function called
print_partitions, which prints all the the different combinations
of prime numbers to stdout. More about these function next.
<p>

Hint: 
You may want to have the function operator set a max_terms 
variable to 2 for even numbers and 3 for odd numbers. 
This variable can be used to speed the compute_partition function 
up by rejecting solutions that involve more prime numbers than
that, e.g., 16 = 2+2+2+... should be deemed a bad solution and 
abandonded since only two prime numbers are needed, 
namely, 11+5 or 13+3.
<p>

Hint:
You may also want to think about the data structures
needed to store the result produced by compute_partition
and used by print_partitions. For example, you may want
to use a vector to hold the list of prime numbers for
a given partition and a vector of vectors to hold
the set of all partitions.
These data structures need to be defined
and initialized somewhere. 
<p>

<LI>
For 40 points, 
implement the missing compute_partitions function. 
This must be a recursive function that enumerates thru
prime numbers that potentially add up to a given
integer. To keep the output to a minimum, this function
should only produce prime number sequences where the
next number is less than or equal to the previous number.
That is, if N=A+B+C+..., then A>=B>=C>=..., e.g.,
16=11+5 or 13+3 but not 5+11 or 3+13.
<p>

Base cases should include when a solution has
been found (number=0), 
when the number being partitioned is invalid 
(number&lt;last number), or when too many terms
are being considered.
<p>

The recursion must use backtracking to iterate thru 
valid prime numbers stored in the pset. This is very
similar to the computation carried out when solving the 
sudoku puzzle. That is, given a list of possible prime
numbers, try each in turn and recursively attempt to 
partition the resulting smaller number. Whether that
fails or succeeds, remove the attempted prime number
and try the next until the list has been exhausted.
<p>

Hint: Let the list of possible prime numbers be bracketed
by two set::iterators that respectively are initialized
to pset.begin() and pset.upper_bound(number). Define a
for-loop that iterates thru this sequence. Add each 
prime number attempted to a partition list before you 
recursively call compute_partitions to partition the 
remaining difference. For example, say the current
number is 16. The list of possible prime numbers are
thus 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. When trying 2, the recursive
call to compute_partitions is given 14 as the next number
to partition (16-2). 

<LI>
For 15 points, 
implement print_partitions which prints all valid prime number 
partitions to stdout. See code behavior examples below.
<p>

<LI>
Run the script /home/cs140/labs/lab8/copy to obtain
a Hydra executable called sgoldbach that works as 
described above.  You also get a makefile and the 
mentioned skeleton program. Run the executable on 
several difference numbers to see how it haves.
Note that prime numbers produce a single prime number.
Some numbers can be partitioned in a very limited
number of ways while others can be partitioned
in many different ways. For example, the output
for 9,999 shown only partially below actually consists
of 21,998 prime number triplets.
