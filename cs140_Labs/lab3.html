<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 3 (200 pts: Spring, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab, you will write four programs
for determining whether numbers are prime numbers or not.
You will progress from an almost C-like program to a
sophisticated C++ program that makes extensive use of STL
functions. 
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas as usual.
Prime1 and Prime2 are both due 11.59PM on Saturday February 16, 2019.
while
Prime3 and Prime4 are both due 11.59PM on Saturday February 23, 2019.
NOTE:
You are likely to find the last two programs somewhat difficult to write.
Pace yourself accordingly. 
In fact, you are strongly encouraged to write the first two programs
faster then indicated by the due dates to buy yourself some time 
for the last two programs.

<h3>Prime number primer</h3>

OK. The header is a lame pun, but this really is a summary of
what prime numbers are and how you compute them. Here we go.

<p>
An integer represents a prime number, if the number is
greater than 1, and its only divisors are 1 and the number
itself. Non-prime numbers are composite in that they
are the product of powers of primes.

<p>
Given a number n, you can determine, if it is prime by
trying to divide increasingly larger numbers into it.
If a particular division is successful, the number is not prime,
and you can stop. What is the biggest number you need to test? 
If you think about it you will quickly realize that 
sqrt(number) sets the limit for your search. Why?
Well, if you divide a number by a number which is greater
than its own square-root, you get a number which is less
than that same square-root. Since you have already tested for it,
there is no need to do it again. Simple as that.

<p>
Hint:
An easy way to check if one integer divides into another is
based on the modulo operator. That is, when n%m equals 0 you
know n divides by m.

<h3>Programs you need to write </h3>

Fire up your favorite editor and write the following four programs.
Be sure to check them rigorously. 

<UL>
<LI>
For 50 points,
write a program called Prime1 which reads an endless 
sequence of integers from stdin and tests whether
each number is prime or not and prints a meaningful
message to stdout if it is.
Example program output is shown below.
Place all your code in "Prime1.cpp" including
function "isprime(int)" which is a boolean function
that does all the checking. 
As usual, the endless input ends
when CTRL-D is encountered.
<p>

<LI>
For 50 points,
write a modified version of Prime1 called Prime2.
Move the "isprime(int)" code into a class
called "isprime" that overloads its function operator
to act as a function object. 
Instantiate an "isprime" object in the main program
and use it to test the input data. 
The program output is as shown below.

<p>
To avoid having to iteratively test each new input
against all possible numbers smaller than its 
square root, create an increasingly larger
list of prime numbers and use a linear search to
see if the number in question is listed or not.
Initially, the list should only contain the number 2.
If you want to see, whether N is prime number, have
the overloaded function operator call
a private member function that expands
the list of known prime numbers to cover N.
Base this magic function on the code
from Prime1 to grow the list such that the largest
prime number known is greater than N. Then test
if N is in the list by traversing the list.
You are encouraged to use
"find()" from STL to do the traversal but
you don't have to.
Note that "find()" returns an iterator to the
element, if it was in the list, and the end-iterator,
if it wasn't found. You must translate this into a boolean
variable that indicates whether the
number N was found in the list or not.

<LI>
For 50 points,
write a modified version of Prime2 called Prime3.
Change "isprime::operator()" to use a binary search
instead of the linear search implemented by "find()"
to determine if input N is a prime number. 
You are encouraged to use
"binary_search()" from STL to do the job.
Note that this algorithm returns a boolean that
indicates whether the number N was found or not.

<p>
Now change the driver code in the main program. 
First, have it use an optional 
command line argument to set the number of
integers to test. Call this number N. If no
command line argument is present, use N=123 as the default. 
Seed the random number generator with N. See the
"clibstd" family of functions for "srand()". 
Second, generate a list of N random numbers in 
the range 1-140.
As a suggestion, write a function object for producing
each random number using "rand()" while
letting "generate()" from STL fill in the list.
Feel free to represent the list using a "vector"
which you may recall is an array-based sequence container.
Third,
use "transform()" from STL along with function 
object "isprime" to obtain a boolean array that 
indicates which random number is prime.
Feed this array to "count()" from STL to
determine how many prime numbers there are.
Print the result to stdout as shown below.

<LI>
For 50 points,
write a modified version of Prime3 called Prime4.
This time all changes are with respect to the
main program.

<p>
Write a function called "extract_prime()" that
takes the two vector arrays holding all the random
numbers and the boolean variables indicating which
are primes as input and produces a new vector of
just the prime numbers.

<p>
Write a function called "print()" which prints
the contents of an array in a formatted fashion
as shown below. Specifically, print 8 integers
per line in a 3-character wide field with a space
separating the numbers.

<p>
Add code that calls these two functions to output
the prime numbers in their order of appearance.
Then sort the data and eliminate any multiples
of the same number. Output the result. Consider
using "sort()" and "unique()" from STL to do
the heavy lifting.

<p>
Hint: If you implemented "Prime4" using vector arrays,
you can use the "erase" member function to get rid of the
unwanted data moved to the end by "unique()".

<LI>
Run the Hydra script /home/cs140/labs/lab3/copy to obtain
four x86-Linux executables that work as described above.
You also get a makefile and four skeleton programs
that might be helpful.
