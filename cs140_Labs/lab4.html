<h1> CS140 -- Lab Assignment 4 (200 pts: Spring, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
This lab has you write a program called Hashtable
which brings together many of the data structures and C++/STL concepts
you have learned about.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
The Hashtable program is due by 11.59pm on Tuesday, March 5, 2019.

<h3>Keeping track of words in files</h3>

All ascii files contain alpha-numerically encoded words plus some
punctuation and control characters such as newline. 
Your task is to write a C++ program called Hashtable.cpp
that reads the ascii file specified on the command-line 
(and provides an error and exits if not present), 
builds a hash table of the words in the file
along with the unique line numbers at which they are found,
and then allows the user to enter an unlimited number of
search terms from stdin. Each search must print 
the line number for each occurrence of the search
term and the corresponding lines of text to stdout. 
Only the first instance of a word on a line should be stored.

See example output below. Note that the program you will
write looks for word occurrences while the unix command
grep looks for word and substring occurences (e.g. "so" is a word
as well as a substring of "awesome").

<p>
All code is to be placed in a single file called
"Hashtable.cpp" with class definitions and utility
functions at the top and the main driver function at the bottom.
Do not split your code into header and source code files.

<h3>Code you need to write </h3>

<UL>
<LI>
For 0 points,
implement hashtable_qp.cpp from the hashtable2_handout. This will
form the base for your work. Make sure the code compiles and runs
as expected. You only need the hash function for string data.

<p>
<LI>
For 60 points, modify the hash_table class code as follows. 

<p>
Augment the hash_table class with a private
subclass called "key_line" which uses a string to hold a
key (word) and a vector of integers to keep track of all the
line numbers where the key is found in the input file. 
You will neither need to implement a constructor or 
a destructor (the defaults will do fine), 
but you must implement a key_line::inuse() member function 
that indicates whether the object holds a key or not.
You will also need to overload the 
comparison operator, i.e., operator==(). 
That's it for key_line
which should be based on a struct instead of a class to make
it readily available to the hash_table member functions.

<p>
Remove all template references used by the hash_table class
which should be modified to explicitly use the key_line
subclass. This includes making
member functions qprobe(), insert(), and resize() all
use key_line::inuse() when checking to see
if an entry exists.

<p>
Modify the hash_table::insert() function to add a 
key if not present in the hash table. 
Update each key_line object to have it
maintain a sorted list of all <it>unique </it> 
line numbers for it (no 
That is, search the line number vector mentioned above
and if not found, add the new line number at the end of
the list. Use std::find() to carry out the search. 

<p>
Add a public member function hash_table::find() 
that returns a constant reference to the vector
of line numbers associated with the hash table entry 
for a given key. If the key is not found, a reference to
an empty vector is returned. You deal with this in 
the main program.

<LI>
For 60 points, modify the main program as follows.

<p>
Check the command line arguments. 
A file is specified as "-f textfile".
If a file has not
been specified, exit the program with a meaningful
error message.

<p>
Open the input file specified by argv[2] and enter into
an endless loop that reads and processes the text lines. 
Save each text line in a cache 
(e.g., vector&lt;string&gt;) for retrieval later on.
Then change all so-called punctuation characters, 
i.e., (, ), {, }, and ., to a blank space. 
Specifically,
wrap std::ispunct(), which can handle the detection 
(see "man ispunct"), inside a function to be called
replace_punctuation() that you pass along to
std::transform() which sweeps thru the text line
characters. Have function
replace_punctuation() return either the character
tested (give as its input argument) or a blank space.
Finally, use a string stream to parse the
resulting text line into words which you insert into
a hash table along with the current line number.
Close the input file when EOF is reached.

<p>
Add a second endless loop that prompts the user for
words to search for. 
Print all line numbers and the corresponding text for each
successfull search. Print nothing for an unsuccessfull search.
Use the vector of line numbers returned by hash_table::find()
to do this. Look up the text in the above mentioned data cache
for each line number.
See output examples below.
<p>

Make no assumptions about the number of lines in the input file.
Make no assumptions about the number of characters or words
on each line.
The test files may be pure ascii text, html code, or even a C++ 
program. Your code should work regardless of the type of ascii
data stored in the file.
<p>

<LI>
For 30 points, modify the hash_table class and main program
as follows.

<p>
The hash_table code is updated to optionally track and 
print simple usage statistics, namely, number of hash table slots
used and available, and total number of collisions
encountered when inserting new data. Introduce needed
boolean variables that control whether and when this is done.
The constructor is given a boolean variable that says whether
to do it. Member function qprobe() is updated to take a second
argument that controls whether collisions are counted or not.
A destructor is added that prints the statistics if collected.

<p>
The main program is updated to accept either of the following
two command-line arguments: "-vf textfile" and "-f textfile". 
The former causes the hash table to collect the mentioned
usage statistics. The latter makes the program run as before.
<p>

<LI> 
Run the script /home/cs140/labs/lab4/copy to obtain
a Hydra executable that works as described above
as well as a makefile.
Other than that, you're on your own!
