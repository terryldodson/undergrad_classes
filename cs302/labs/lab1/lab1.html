<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 1 (150 pts: Fall 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Welcome to your first CS302 lab which consists of two parts that
both focus on sorting. 
In Part A,
you implement a data structure for storing multi-column data
consisting of a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number 
(all made up, but you knew that),
read unspecified amounts of such data from stdin and apply
the std::sort algorithm before you print the result to stdout.
In Part B,
you implement a variant of the quicksort algorithm 
described in class that in its basic form replaces std::sort and
in a more advanced version allows partitioning of the data followed
by sorting within a given range.
The latter extension will be based on the quickselect algorithm
also described in class.
You will also add command line option handling for selecting
a particular method.
<p>

Read the assignment a couple of times. Look at the output 
examples below. Run the solution code to become familiar 
with its behavior. Ask questions on Piazza so the whole
class can benefit from your confusion. Chances are you 
are not alone. Do this for every lab assignment.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Your friendly TAs will tell you how to submit your work to Canvas.
Do not email your code to the instructor or the TAs as they cannot 
upload the code to Canvas for you.
<p>

Part A is due 11:59pm Sunday Sep 1, 2019.
Part B is due 11:59pm Wednesday Sep 11, 2019.
You only submit one file each time. The incremental
development outlined below is merely intended to make
solving the problem more manageable. 
All submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.
<p>

Aim to submit Part A early, so you get a head start 
on the command line option handling. That way, you get
more time to work on the quicksort and quickselect code.

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab1/copy to obtain the following files:
QsortA.cpp and QsortB.cpp (skeleton code), sqsort (Hydra solution
executable), list1.txt-list3.txt (data files),
and a makefile.
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
<p>

Develop your code in stages as described next.
QsortA.cpp must contain ALL code needed to
first satisfy Part A.
You then copy and update this file to satisfy Part B.
You will work with multi-file assignments in later labs.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
Part A Vers. 1: Use your favorite editor to modify QsortA.cpp 
as follows. 
Add code for the input 
and output operators associated with the data class 
which has three private
data members: firstname, lastname, and phonenumber. 
The input operator simply reads each of these every time it is
called.
The output operator prints a data object using 
the format: lastname firstname phonenumber. 
See examples below. Part of the assignment is for you
to figure out how to maintain a fixed width of the name field 
so that all phonenumbers are left justified to the same column 
position.
Finally, implement printlist() as a template function that 
takes generic iterator arguments and steps thru the data
while printing to stdout.
Do whatever else is needed to make the program compile such as
adding missing header files. Then test and make sure it
reads and writes data from the list files as required.
<p>

<pre>
unix> QsortA < list.txt
</pre>

<LI>
Part A Vers. 2: Add an overloaded operator&lt; to the data class,
so you can impose an order on such objects. Test that it works by
applying the std::sort algorithm before writing the list content 
to stdout. Objects that store the same lastname should use the
firstnames to determine which is less than the other. Objects
that also store the same firstnames should use the phone numbers
to determine which is less than the other. See examples below.
<p>

This completes Part A. Submit QsortA.cpp on Canvas after you have
cleaned the code up and added a few comments.

<LI>
Part B Vers. 1: 
Add command line argument handling. When completed, any one
of the following three ways of calling QsortB will be valid:
<p>

<pre>
unix> QsortB -stl < list.txt
unix> QsortB -rpivot < list.txt
unix> QsortB -rpivot k0 k1 < list.txt
</pre>

<p>
The first version executes the code from Part A. 
The second version uses your own implementation of quicksort
to sort the data. 
The third version partitions the input data as described
below before applying quicksort to sort the data in the
range given by integers k0 and k1. Without checking,
we will assume that k0 is less than k1. 
Do check if k0 is less than 0, in which case 
it should silently be changed to 0. 
Likewise, check if k1 is greater than or equal to the number of 
elements in the data array, say N, and if so, silently change 
it to N-1.
<p>

<LI>
Part B Vers. 2: 
Implement quicksort as follows.
Copy the partition_median2() and quicksort_median2() functions 
from the sorting4 handout.
Replace the median-of-three pivot with a randomly chosen
index in the left-to-right range and use it to partition the data.
This new version forces you to think about how the median-of-three
partitioning code works as unlike it, you must now explicitly check and 
prevent going out-bounds during the search for data pairs to swap. 
To make you think even more about the
algorithm, merge all the functionality into the quicksort()
function. That is, do not have an external function that carries
out the partitioning. Keep it all in one function that gets called
from the main() function.
Test and compare the output with what you obtained using std::sort. 
The two output should be identical since they use the same comparison
operator.
<p>

<LI>
Part B Vers. 3: Copy the quickselect() function from the sorting4
handout. Embed the random pivot based partition code that you
added to quicksort() in Part B Vers. 2. The function will take four
arguments, i.e., quickselect(A, left, k, right) where A is a data
array, left and right designate the first and the last indices
to consider (the range), and k the element that needs to be
selected (found and put in its proper place).
Make whatever other modifications
are needed to get the code to compile. 
Test the program to make sure you the selection is correct.
<p>

Use quickselect(A, 0, k0, N-1) to put the k0-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly.
That is, ensure that all data stored to the left of A[k0]
is lexicographically less than or equal to it.
All data stored to the right of A[k0] must likewise be
greater than or equal to it.
<p>

Then
use quickselect(A, k0, k1, N-1) to put the k1-th element in its
proper location and partition the data in A accordingly. Note
that data indexed below k0 is ignored at this point. When this
works, use the quicksort() function to sort the data in the 
k0 thru k1 index range.
<p>

This completes Part B. Submit QsortB.cpp on Canvas after 
you have cleaned the code up and added a few comments.

The line numbers added to right for the last output are for illustrational purposes 
and not produced by the program. They help you see that the data in lines 3-6 is sorted
(by design), that the data lines 0-1 and 9-10 is not, and that the data in lines 2 and
7-8 is (by chance).
