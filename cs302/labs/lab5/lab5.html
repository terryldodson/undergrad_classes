<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 5 (125 pts: Fall 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
ACME Shipping needs your help! They have obtained the rights
to ship goods between a number of cities across the world. 
Use your newly acquired knowledge about graphs to write
a program called "citysim" that can tell ACME Shipping 
what the shortest valid route is between any two cities. 
Being customer friendly, ACME Shipping wants to explore two 
options: (i) a cheap rate based on distance traveled and
(ii) a more expensive rate based on time in transit.
See details below. Lots of them.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>

Submit your work via Canvas no later than
11:59pm Wednesday October 23, 2019.
You submit only one file called Citysim.cpp.
The incremental development outlined below is merely
intended to walk you through the process of completing
the assignment.
CS307 students will write additional code as outlined
below. CS302 are free to write this code as well but
there is no extra credit to be earned this time.
<p>

<b>
While it may seem like you have a long time to do this
assignment, keep in mind that Fall Break is coming up.
Thus, you really only a week to get the job done. 
Make sure you have
code that compiles and does at least part of the
assignment, if not all of it by the due date.
</b>

<hr>
<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab5/copy to obtain the following files:
scitysim (Hydra solution executable), 
city_list.txt (input data),
Citysim.cpp (skeleton code), and a makefile.
Your job is to write the citysim program
and make it behave as described next.
<p>

While you have some design freedom,
you must base your code on the classes
and functions discussed next.
How you tie them all together is up to you.
Also,
floating-point computations should be done
using floats, not doubles. Most math functions
take and produce doubles. That's fine. Feed
them floats and assign the output to floats.
<p>

<b>
Please raise concerns about assignment
inconsistencies or unspoken design criteria on
Piazza.com sooner rather than later, so that
clarifications can be shared with the class
as early as possible.
</b>
<p>

You might find it helpful to take a glance at the 
city_list.txt snippet included below before you continue
reading.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
<b>Version 1</b> should implement a city class that
stores the name (string), type (string), 
zone (int),
latitude (float), longitude (float) and
population (int). Make these variables
private data members. Add get_variable()
functions for each variable.
Overload the input and output operators to
facilitate
"fin &gt;&gt; city" and 
"fout &lt;&lt; city"
type code. 
The city type is either REGIONAL or GATEWAY. 
We discuss these in more detail below.
<p>

Next, implement function read_cityinfo() which reads
the "city_list.txt" file in the current directory
into a vector&lt;city&gt; array using the overloaded
city input operator.
Empty lines or lines that begin with a hash symbol
(#) should be ignored. 
You may find it convenient to also implement function 
write_cityinfo() which writes the contents of 
the vector&lt;city&gt; array to stdout or an
appropriately named file, so you know you read things
correctly.
See below for example output from the solution code
which produces a file called "city_info.txt".
The name field is 18 characters wide. The type
and population fields are 12 and 10 characters wide,
respectively. The zone is 2 characters wide.
The latitude and longitude fields
are 8 characters wide and the output is restricted
to two decimal places.
<p>

Note: The latitude and longitude values are
in degrees in city_list.txt and city_info.txt. 
However, your program will need them to be 
in radians for internal use.
Perform the necessary conversion when you
read and write these variables. Recall
that radians=degrees*(pi/180) and
degrees=radians*(180/pi).
<p>

<LI>
<b>Version 2</b> should implement a travelcost 
class which computes and contains a table
of distances between all cities and a table
of the time it takes to get from one
city to another.
Since the distance from A to B is the 
same as from B to A, store each of these tables
in a 1D array that holds the diagonal and
lower triangle of the full matrix;
we don't need the diagonal, but including it simplifies
implementation. Say the equivalent 2D table[i][j] is NxN. Then the 1D
table is of size N*(N+1)/2 and you access the elements using
using table[i*(i+1)/2+j] where j &lt;i. You are free to create
two independent tables, but you may find it more convenient to
use an array of vectors instead. That is,

<pre>
vector&lt;float&gt; distance_table;
vector&lt;float&gt; time_table;
</pre>

or

<pre>
vector&lt;float&gt; table[2];
</pre>

Either way, create an overloaded function operator that returns the same 
value for travelcost(mode,i,j) as for travelcost(mode,j,i) by
looking the appropriate value in the 1D array. Here mode refers to
distance (0) or time (1).
Hint: Have the overloaded function operator swap
arguments i and j if i &lt;j before doing a lookup.
Hint: The mode controls whether you look up a distance or a time.
<p>

Use the great-circle distance when computing
the distance between two cities. This
is the shortest distance between them on a sphere
representing the Earth which
we will assume has a radius of 3,982 miles. 
Don't try to be clever and use a more accurate 
radius as it will throw your output off relative to the
solution code
which filed called "city_info.txt".
Also, use the Haversine Formula 
for your computation.
<p>

See 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance"
TARGET="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance</a>
for mathematical details. 
<p>

Round the distances to the closest 25.0 mile distance. 
This will make it easier to compare your distances with those
produced by the solution code.
Hint: Set distance = 25.0*round(distance/25.0).
<p>

ACME Shipping has access to large fleet of trucks. They
travel at an average speed of 65 mph. They also have
access to planes. They travel at an average speed of 520 mph.
The rules for when to use a truck versus a plane are 
as follows.
<p>

-- Goods shipped between REGIONAL cities in the same zone
go by truck.
<p>

-- Goods shipped between REGIONAL cities and a GATEWAY city
in the same zone go by plane.
<p>

-- Goods shipped between GATEWAY cities go by plane no
matter what the zone they are in.
<p>

You may find it convenient to also implement functions
write_traveldistance() 
write_traveltime() 
which write the contents of the travelcost tables
stdout or appropriately named files, 
so you know you compute these correctly.
See below for example output from the solution code
which produces files called "city_distancetable.txt".
and "city_timetable.txt".
<p>

<LI>
<b>Version 3</b>
should implement function create_citygraph()
which determines which cities are adjacent to
one another (connected) thereby implicitly creating a
graph. The rules for adjacency are as follows.
<p>

-- A REGIONAL city is adjacent to all other REGIONAL cities 
in the same zone. A REGIONAL city is also adjacent to the 
closest GATEWAY city in the same zone.
<p>

-- A GATEWAY city is adjacent to all other GATEWAY cities
in the same zone. A GATEWAY city is also adjacent to the
closest GATEWAY in each of the other zones if the distance
is 6,000 miles or less.
<p>

-- In order to make the graph undirected, adjacency is
bidirectional. 
Thus, if A is adjacent to B, then B is also adjacent to A.
This can result in a GATEWAY city becoming connected with
multiple GATEWAY cities in another zone 
(see for example Cairo_EG below).
<p>

Hint: 
First extract an index list for each type of city.
Then iterate thru these lists following the above
rules. Use the indices to look up the pertinent
information in the vector&lt;city&gt; array discussed
above. In fact, think of these indices as pointers.
<p>

You may find it convenient to also implement a function
called write_citygraph() 
and have it write the graph to stdout or an appropriately named fil.
so you know you connected the cities correctly.
See below for example output from the solution code
which produces a file called "city_graph.txt".
<p>

<LI>
<b>Version 4</b> 
should add the ability to determine
the shortest path between any two cities
using Dijkstra's algorithm. The output
consists of the sequence of cities from 
source to sink (destination) along with the
incremental and cumulative distances and 
travel times.
This is likely the easiest step of them all.
Embed the code from the Dijkstra code handout.
Add logic to select between use of the
distance and time edge weights you computed earlier.
The algoithm works the same either way but wil
produce different answers if the optimal
paths are different. See an example below.
<p>

Update the main program to 
take one of two command-line options:

<pre>
unix> Citysim -distance|time
</pre>

Then have the user input an endless sequence of city pair names
for which the shorted path is reported.
Hint: In order to translate
the names into the indices used internally, have
the read_cityinfo() function create
a map that links the two: "index = map[name]".
This will allow fast lookup of an
index given a name. 
<p>

<LI>
<b>The following is optional for CS302 students (no extra credit this time) but
required in order for CS307 students to get full credit.
That is, CS307 students will have up to 10 points deducted
if the functionality described next is not included or doesn't work right. 
</b>
<p>

Add the ability to input just
a partial name, e.g., "Knoxville" or even just "Knox"
for "Knoxville_TN". In case of ambiguity, choose the 
city name that follows the partial name in a
lexicographical order, e.g., 
"K" should produce "Kansas_City_KS" instead of
"Knoxville_TN" if present.
Run the solution code to determine the desired behavior.
Your code should function similarly. 
Hint: The STL algorithm map::upper_bound() can do 
the lookup for you.

As shown above, the solution code accepts abbreviations. When multiple cities
share the same prefix, alphabetical order applies. 
The solution code even accepts wildcards in which case it randomly choses
a city. You can use this feature for source, destination, or both.
