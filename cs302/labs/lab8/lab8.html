<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 8 (100 pts: Fall 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Inheritance is a powerfull way for letting objects share
member data and function definitions. In this lab, 
you will gain hands-on experience with this concept.
<p>

<b>Warning:</b> The following is a somewhat incomplete and sketchy 
description. You will not be given nearly the same
level of detailed how-to instructions you have seen earlier in the
semester. This is your time to be creative and do it your way 
(sort of). Ask questions in class and on Piazza till you understand
the assignment. Do this sooner rather than later.

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit a tar file which contains completed Data_processor.cpp,
Person.h, Person.cpp and Sptrsort.h files via Canvas
no later than 11:59pm Tuesday December 3, 2019.
<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> This is a one week assignment. You get two weeks to do it
because of Thanksgiving. 
Also, you will get a chance to make up (a few) lost points in the very 
near future. The due date for that will coincide with the due date for 
Lab 8. Plan accordingly.

<p
<hr>
<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started, run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab8/copy to obtain the following files:
sdata_generator and sdata_processor (Hydra executables),
Data_processor.cpp (skeleton driver program source code),
Person.h and Person.cpp (data definition skeleton files).
Sptrsort.h (smart pointer skeleton file),
and a makefile (for compiling Data_processor).
<p>

The idea behind the lab is to have you read XML data from
a file and produce a sorted and formatted version thereof 
to stdout.
As with previous labs, you will build up to the final version
step by step. Here are the details. You may have to read the
assignment a couple of times before it makes sense. Also,
look at the example output below to get a better idea of
what's going on.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Sptrsort.h:</b> This file is empty. 
Add the smartpointer class from the corresponding
code handout. Have the sprtsort() function
set up the smartpointer array and before it
calls std::sort(). Before returning, the result
of the sort is used to reorder the input data.
Note: The input data is (should be) a vector 
of pointers.
Don't simply use the data2ptr() and ptr2data()
functions from the code handout since that was
based on a vector of data values.
<p>

<b>Person.h and Person.cpp:</b>
These files are empty apart from an enum 
declaration. Your job is add the definitions for
the three classes: person, faculty, and student.
The person.cpp file is equally empty. This is where
you place the code which implements the class
member functions. 
<p>

<b>Data_processor.cpp:</b>
This file contains the main function which
reads and parses the XML data from file
(most of this code is provided to you 
``free of charge'').
You will need to add
code to store the XML data in a list of person 
objects which you then process.
When you look at the file, you will see what's missing.
You will also add a processing part that consists
of user specified sorting on either person objects,
faculty objects or student objects. More on this below.

<LI>
<b>Version 1:</b>
Modify the main program
and create a person class that allows you to
read the name of each person. Pay no attention
to faculty versus student and ignore all course
data. You will need to create the person class,
overload both operator<() and friend operator<<()
in order to print a sorted list of names to stdout.
Implement and use the Sprtsort code for the sorting.
<p>

When eventually adding the courses, 
sort them alphabetically.
For student entries, also print grade points earned
as well as the commulative GPA (for the alphabetically
sorted list -- not based on the order in which they
took courses).
<p>

<LI>
<b>Version 2:</b> 
Add the faculty and student classes. 
These should be derived from the person
class which in turn will need to have any private
members be made protected. 
See <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jgregor/cs302/lab8_UML.pdf target="blank"> 
UML diagram</a>
for a pictorial view of these classes, their relationships and
members (+X means X is a public member, 
#X means X is a protected member, and
-X means X is a private member). 
Note: You may need to shrink the PDF when viewing it.
<p>

Make the person class a base class by adding
virtual member functions 
that allow the derived faculty and student
classes to control what they do if they do it
differently (this is polymorphism). For example,
faculty will maintain a list of course names 
while students while maintain both course names 
and grade points (GP). 
Print faculty and student details thru the
overloaded person friend operator<<().
When printing student data, add a commulative GPA
to the right the course GP value.
<p>

Update the main program to create and add 
faculty and student objects to the database
instead of person objects. 
Overload the person operator<() to facilitate 
sorting of the data first by faculty then by
student and within each category alphabetically
by full name (i.e., "Firstname Lastname").
<p>

<LI>
<b>Version 3:</b> 
Modify the main program to accept a commandline
option that determines whether to print
person entries (sorted by faculty then student
with members of each type sorted
alphabetically), faculty entries
(sorted by first by
order of assistant, 
associate and full professors, then 
alphabetically within each category),
and student entries (sorted first by order
of freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior
class status, then alphabetically).
See output examples below.
<p>

<LI>
For all code, keep the layout defined in the
files given to you.
Include only header files needed. 
Maintain the highest level of privacy possible. Make 
member data and functions public or protected only
when necessary. Likewise, create only member functions
that are needed. Declare functions purely virtual 
(abstract) in the base class if only the derived
classes can define them. 
<p>

Pay close attention to the definition of
constructors and destructors. Make sure derived
class destructors get activated. That is, watch
out for memory leaks. You can run valgrind
on your executable to see if you have any -- 
if you do, fix them.
