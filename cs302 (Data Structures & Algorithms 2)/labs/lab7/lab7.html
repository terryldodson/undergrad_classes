<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 7 (100 pts: Fall, 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab, you will use 
the dynamic programming based algorithm covered in class
for determining the
longest common subsequence given two strings 
to implement "Diff7" which is a scaled-back version of 
the Unix command diff.
The program shows the user if two text files are different 
and if so, how to edit one into the other: which lines
to delete, which lines to add, and which lines to replace
(refered to below as change).
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit the completed Diff6.cpp file
via Canvas no later than
11:59pm Tuesday November 19, 2019.

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started, run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab7/copy to obtain the following files:
sdiff7 (Hydra solution executable),
Diff7.cpp (skeleton driver program source code),
a makefile, and two test files called original.txt
and modified.txt. 
The text is based on a poem for 
6th graders written by Kenn Nesbitt (2005).
<p>

<UL>

<LI> 
Create a class called LCS which has public member functions
for adding text to two private buffers called text1 and text2 as
well as for public member functions for
computing the dynamic programming based alignment 
and subsequently reporting the difference between the files.
<p>

<LI>
Public member function compute_alignment() uses a
cost function that associates deletions and insertions with
a cost of 1, sets the cost of a perfect match to 0 and doesn't
allow substitutions. These edit operations apply to <i>lines</i>
of text, not symbols. That is, the goal is determine the
fewest number of lines that need to be deleted from text1 and
inserted from text2 in order to make the two become identical.
Thus, a match only occurs when two <i>lines</i> of text
are identical.
<p>

<LI>
Public member function report_difference() is conveniently
implemented as wrapper for
a recursive private member function of the same name that
uses link information 
provided by compute_alignment() to extract the the sequence of
edit operations that solves the alignment problem. While
many such sequences may exist, we are only interested in
one. The sdiff7 executable provided to you chooses 
a match if possible followed first by an insertion and then 
a deletion.
If the
three operations all have different costs, the order in which
we consider them doesn't matter. Occasionally, two or more
will cost the same, and then a different order will produce
a different unique edit sequence. 
<b>
Be sure to use the 
suggested order of comparisons to be consistent with the solution 
code 
(which may or may not be consistent with the Unix version of
diff).
</b>
<p>

<LI>
Once the trace, which represents the
sequence of edit opeations, has been extracted,
you need to parse it. That is, the program output should
ultimately reflect edits based on <i>sequences</i> 
of deletions (remove text from file1), 
insertions (add text from file2), and 
changes (replace text from file1 with text from file2). 
For example,
the edit sequence DELETE, DELETE, 
MATCH, INSERT, INSERT, DELETE, 
MATCH, MATCH, INSERT, MATCH
should be condensed to DELETE two lines from file1,
CHANGE one line from file1 into two lines from file2, 
and INSERT one line from file2 
with explicit reference to the lines involved.
Once you think about it, you quickly realize that the
MATCH operations determine the start 
and end of these sequences. You will find an example
included below. Study it carefully. Then study it again.
If the output confuses you, read descriptions of the
Unix command diff which produces similar type of output.
(The man page may not be very helpful -- Google will
return links to more informative explanations).
Consider using a private member function
to handle printing of the edit information.
