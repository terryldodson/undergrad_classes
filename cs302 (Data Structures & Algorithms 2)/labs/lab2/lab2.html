<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 2 (100 pts: Fall 2019)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab you will continue sorting the multi-column
data from Lab 1 which consisted of
a firstname, a lastname, and a phone number.
The main difference is that data will
now be stored in single linked list.
In order to allow sorting by means of STL sorting algorithms
(or any of the ones covered in class),
you will embed the smart pointer concept within the single linked 
list class and write the associated code for setting things up
and applying the result.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit the Slist.h and Slist_usage.cpp files via Canvas no 
later than 11:59pm Wednesday Sep 18, 2019.
Note:
The incremental development outlined below is merely intended 
to make solving the problem more manageable. Do not submit
the various stages of the code.
<p>

<hr>

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab2/copy to obtain the following files: 
Slist.h and Slist_usage.cpp (skeleton code), sslist_usage 
(Hydra solution executable), a makefile, and
dbl_list[123].txt (test files).
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
Slist.h Vers 1:
Implement the slist::node::constructor that
takes a data argument; 
this functionality is needed by slist::push_back() 
when it creates a new node.
<p>

Slist_usage.cpp Vers 1:
Add the definition of class data from QsortA.cpp
from Lab 1 along with the associated input and
output operators 
and the template based printlist function.
Add needed header files and do whatever else 
it takes for the code to compile (shouldn't be 
much and may be as simple as commenting incomplete
code out), then test and make sure you can 
read the dbl_list[123].txt files and print
them back to stdout.
<p>

<LI>
Slist.h Vers 2:
Add an overloaded less-than comparison operator
to the node subclass.
Embed the smart pointer code as a private slist subclass; 
copy the code verbatim from the smartpointer_handout,
then modify it to explicitly work for slist::node data.
<p>

Update the slist::sort() function to sort the 
single linked list data using the std::sort() function.
Determine the number of elements stored in the list.
Allocate a vector of smart pointers of that size
called Ap.
Initialize the individual smart pointers 
to point to the list nodes. 
For example, if p = head, then Ap[0] = p-&gt;next, etc.
Apply std::sort
and use the sorted Ap vector to relink the list nodes.
Do not simply repeat the array based
rearrangement covered in class which used pointers
to the data itself. Here, the smart pointers point
to nodes that hold the data.
Also, keep in mind that operator[] is not available. 
You will need to use list node pointers.
When the sorting is done, step through the smart 
pointer vector while creating the linked list. 
For example, if p = head, then p-&gt;next = Ap[0], etc.
Simple as that (once you figure it out). You may
want to draw a picture of what's going on to
help visualize the process.
<p>

Slist_usage.cpp Vers 2:
Update the main function to call slist::sort
with an appropriate argument. Compile and
test the code using the dbl_list[123].txt files.
<p>

<LI>
Slist.h Vers 3:
Add logic to call std::sort if slist::sort is
called with the string "quicksort" and
std::stable_sort if the argument is "mergesort".
<p>

Slist_usage.cpp Vers 3:
Add command line argument handling. 
Seek inspiration from QsortB.cpp.
When completed, either of the following two ways of 
executing Slist_usage will be valid:
<p>

<pre>
unix> Slist_usage -quicksort < list.txt
unix> Slist_usage -mergesort < list.txt
</pre>

The program should print usage information if
given any other options or none.
<p>
Finally, add an integer ID to class data's private
member section. Update the input operator to
set this to the reflect the order of appearance
of a data object in the input stream. Update
the output operator to print this ID. 
Compare performance for quicksort and mergesort.
For some data, you will see that identical data
objects appear in the wrong order for quicksort,
while mergesort always maintains the correct
order.

Notice that the AGUILAR BRITNEY entries are printed in reverse order of
appearance for quicksort while mergesort (which is stable) prints them in the 
correct order. You will see many more examples, if you look at all the output 
for dbl_list2.txt and dbl_list3.txt.

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>

Note1: Output format of your program must MATCH 
that of the solution executable.
Use the diff command to compare.
<br> 
Note2: If your program does not compile, 
it will likely not be graded and instead assigned a default score of 0.

<h4> Slist_usage (100)</h4>
<pre>
10: Base code for reading and writing listX.txt files and storing data in an slist.
15: Embedded smart pointer subclass with explicit application to slist::node data. 
50: Function slist::sort which creates smart pointer array, sorts it using std::sort,
    and applies results to relink slist nodes in sorted order.
15: Command line option handling with corresponding slist::sort functionality.
10: Line ID handling added to data class and associated input/output operators.
